 * This ViewHelper prevents rendering of any content inside the tag
 * Note: Contents of the comment will still be **parsed** thus throwing an
 * Exception if it contains syntax errors. You can put child nodes in
 * CDATA tags to avoid this.
 *
 * = Examples =
 *
 * <code title="Commenting out fluid code">
 * Before
 * <f:comment>
 *   This is completely hidden.
 *   <f:debug>This does not get rendered</f:debug>
 * </f:comment>

 *
 * <code title="Prevent parsing">
 * <f:comment><![CDATA[

 * ]]></f:comment>

 * <output>
 * </output>
 *
 * Note: Using this view helper won't have a notable effect on performance, especially once the template is parsed.
 * However it can lead to reduced readability. You can use layouts and partials to split a large template into smaller
 * parts. Using self-descriptive names for the partials can make comments redundant.
