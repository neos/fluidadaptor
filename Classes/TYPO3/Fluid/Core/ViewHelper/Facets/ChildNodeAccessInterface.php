/**
 * Child Node Access Facet. View Helpers should implement this interface if they
 * need access to the direct children in the Syntax Tree at rendering-time.
 * This might happen if you only want to selectively render a part of the syntax
 * tree depending on some conditions.
 * To render subnodes, you can fetch the RenderingContext via $this->renderingContext.
 *
 * In most cases, you will not need this facet, and it is NO PUBLIC API!
 * Right now it is only used internally for conditions, so by subclassing TYPO3\Fluid\Core\ViewHelpers\AbstractConditionViewHelper, this should be all you need.
 *
 * See \TYPO3\Fluid\ViewHelpers\IfViewHelper for an example how it is used.
