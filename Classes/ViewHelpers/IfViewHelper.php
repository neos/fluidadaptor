/**
 * This view helper implements an if/else condition.
 * @see F3\Fluid\Core\Parser\SyntaxTree\ViewHelperNode::convertArgumentValue() to find see how boolean arguments are evaluated
 *
 * = Conditions =
 *
 * As a condition is a boolean value, you can just use a boolean argument.
 * Alternatively, you can write a boolean expression there.
 * Boolean expressions have the following form:
 * XX Comparator YY
 * Comparator is one of: ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= and %
 * The % operator converts the result of the % operation to boolean.
 *
 * XX and YY can be one of:
 * - number
 * - Object Accessor
 * - Array
 * - a ViewHelper
 * Note: Strings at XX/YY are NOT allowed.
 *
 * <code title="condition example">
 * <f:if condition="{rank} > 100">
 *   Will be shown if rank is > 100
 * </f:if>
 * <f:if condition="{rank} % 2">
 *   Will be shown if rank % 2 != 0.
 * </f:if>
 * <f:if condition="{rank} == {k:bar()}">
 *   Checks if rank is equal to the result of the ViewHelper "k:bar"
 * </f:if>
 * </code>
 *
 * = Examples =
 *
 * <code title="Basic usage">
 * <f:if condition="somecondition">
 *   This is being shown in case the condition matches
 * </f:if>
 * </code>
 *
 * Everything inside the <f:if> tag is being displayed if the condition evaluates to TRUE.

 * <f:if condition="somecondition">
 *   <f:then>
 *     This is being shown in case the condition matches.

 *   <f:else>
 *     This is being displayed in case the condition evaluates to FALSE.
 *   </f:else>
 * </f:if>

 *
 * Everything inside the "then" tag is displayed if the condition evaluates to TRUE.
